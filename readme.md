## Blog app
This is a small blog website based on a youtube tutorial:
<a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8B4og-BeCk&list=PLwAKR305CRO-Q90J---jXVzbOd4CDRbVx"> How to build a Blog with Laravel</a>

it should be used for learning purposes only and still needs http sanitation.

to run the project just do `npm install`, and don't forget to update the `.env` file with your database credentials.

finally `php artisan serve`
